# ObjectBrowserController
Use an object of a specified colour to scroll through your browser by simply moving the object up or down
The colour of the object is set to yellow by me. The colour can be changed by changing the range at any moment.
The intent of the project is to only scroll up or down on the browser without touching your laptop.
